This is a simple 3D printable model for you to attach a UHF yagi to a standard camera tripod, the yagi should be ~20mm boom diameter and using a similiar size u-shape antenna mounting bracket to bond it to the printed item.
Better use PETG or something similiar filament for better strength but PLA should do (at least couple times of use).
